## 📝 Project Status
We started this project on Sep 11, 2023, and not yet finished (more information can be found in the commit history). (changed)
The project was initially planned to be finished in 2 weeks with basic GUI and functions. We're in the development stage, so lots of bugs will exist. 
The commit history will not show the real contribution of each member. 
We had a lot of discussions at the library to decide what to do for each project's progress. 
In order for the members not to create many structurally different pieces of code, we decided to focus on a single machine (leader's potato machine) during almost all development stages.
